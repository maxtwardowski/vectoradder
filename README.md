# vectoradder
Java Vector 'Adder' created for academic purposes

The task:
_Write a program asking for two vectors (in mathematical sense). The end of the vector is marked by enter key. If any of the given element is not a number, it is ignored. Then try to add vectors, if their lengths are equal. If not, cast DifferentVectorsLengthException (you have to write this exception), with which you can specify and read the length of the vectors. If vectors were equal, result of the addition is written to the file. If vectors weren't equal, the user is prompted to re-enter the vectors._
